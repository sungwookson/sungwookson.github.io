## Motivation

After our initial discussion with Carlos, we set clear goals for our project. Our primary objective for this quarter was to develop a functional camera module prototype. We measured our progress by achieving key milestones.

Our first milestone was acquiring essential components, including a Raspberry Pi and a third-party camera module. Next, we focused on technical aspects such as configuring the Raspberry Pi, establishing a wireless video streaming system, and creating a user-friendly web interface with servo control.

Our final milestone involved enclosing the module in a 3D-printed prototype to assess durability. Throughout the project, we prioritized cost-effectiveness while maintaining functionality and quality. We sourced most hardware components at minimal cost, and software tools were freely available.

We also saved costs by utilizing existing Raspberry Pi and servo gear resources. We maintained a strong commitment to timely completion of milestones.
